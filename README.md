#  Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project uses machine learning to classify the forest cover type based on cartographic variables such as elevation, soil type, and wilderness area. It was completed as part of my Machine Learning internship.

##  Problem Statement

Classify forest cover types using features like elevation, aspect, slope, and soil type to support environmental management and conservation.

##  Objectives
- Build a classification model to predict cover type
- Achieve high test accuracy
- Analyze important features and improve interpretability

##  Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Records: ~580,000+
- Features: 54 (continuous and categorical)
- Target: Cover_Type (1 to 7)

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Random Forest, StratifiedKFold

##  Model Performance
- **Train Accuracy**: ~98%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~89%
- Best Model: Random Forest
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation

##  Visuals
- Feature Importance Plot  
- Confusion Matrix Heatmap  
- Train vs Test Accuracy Comparison  
- Correlation Heatmap

##  Future Work
- Deploy as a web app  
- Add deep learning models  
- Integrate real-time geospatial data
